        <p>11th Avenue Foods was originally started based on the demands of the local clienteles and then it was transformed into a full-service provider getting products right to the customers. We believe in hard work, the best product available, competitive pricing, great customer service, natural and healthy way of farming. These standards enabled 11th Avenue Foods to outgrow their original location and open multiple locations in South East Asia.</p>
        <p>
          Industrial, chemical farming was the only existing option for survival. But we didn't want to be industrial, chemical farmers. And we didn't want to be at the mercy of corporate agriculture. We knew we had to do something, there had to be a better way-a more sustainable way-to continue farming like we always had. In a way that protects the land, animals, economy and people's health.</p>
        <p>
          We support local farmers and we give our best training to them in organic farming to grow our products the way it is intended to be grown. Knowledge and exposure to farm life will help invest future generations in local agriculture.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-4">Organic Forming</h3>
        <p>
          Organic farming is a form of agriculture that relies on sustainable techniques to enhance the natural fertility of a farm, including crop rotation, companion planting, biological pest control, and naturally-sourced fertilizers such as compost, manure, green manure, and bone meal.</p>
        <p>
          We at 11th Avenue Foods believe that the organic food is the purest source of energy with all nutrients preserved in their natural states. Maintaining the natural ecosystem is our prime focus at 11th Avenue Foods. We always care for the earth and farmers who fair share their contributions in crop productions. Artificial ingredients, coloring agents, and chemical preservatives are never being used in our food which makes it more useful for healthy lifestyle. Our Forefathers have given us the gift on how to do farming the right way and at the same time maintaining the highest standards that can be offered</p>
        <p>
          We have done our due diligence and have taken strides to improve our techniques, so we can be very competitive not only in this growing market but also give customers the best quality product that they can trust and consume</p>
